# Shared Architecture

## 📦 Overview

The shared package provides common interfaces, utilities, and types used across both frontend and backend applications in the monorepo.

## 🏗 Architecture Components

### Package Structure

- **Interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces for data models and API contracts
- **Utilities**: Shared utility functions and helpers
- **Types**: Common type definitions and enums
- **Constants**: Application-wide constants and configuration

### Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript interfaces ensure consistency
- **Reusability**: Common code shared between frontend and backend
- **Consistency**: Standardized data structures across applications
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for shared types
