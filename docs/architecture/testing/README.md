# Testing Architecture

## 🧪 Overview

The testing architecture is designed to ensure code quality and reliability across the monorepo with comprehensive testing strategies for frontend, backend, and shared packages.

## 🏗 Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid

- **Unit Tests**: Component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: API and service integration
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full application workflows

### Key Principles

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick test execution for development
- **Reliable Tests**: Consistent and deterministic test results
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Critical paths and edge cases covered

## 📋 Documentation Sections

### [Unit Testing](./unit-testing.md)

Learn about component testing, service testing, and testing utilities for Angular applications.

### [Integration Testing](./integration-testing.md)

Understand API testing, database testing, and service integration patterns.

### [E2E Testing](./e2e-testing.md)

Discover end-to-end testing strategies, user workflows, and browser automation.

## 🚀 Testing Tools

### Frontend Testing

- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **Angular Testing Utilities**: Component and service testing
- **Testing Library**: User-centric testing approaches

### Backend Testing

- **Jest**: Node.js testing framework
- **Supertest**: HTTP API testing
- **Test Containers**: Database testing

### E2E Testing

- **Playwright**: Modern browser automation
- **Cypress**: Alternative E2E framework
